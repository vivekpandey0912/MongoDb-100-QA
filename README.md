1. What is MongoDB?
MongoDB is a NoSQL database management system that stores data in a JSON-like format, known as BSON (Binary JSON). It is designed to be scalable and flexible, making it suitable for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.

2. What is BSON?
BSON stands for Binary JSON, and it is the binary-encoded format used to store data in MongoDB. It is similar to JSON but allows for additional data types and efficient binary encoding.

3. What is the primary difference between MongoDB and traditional relational databases?
MongoDB is a NoSQL database, while traditional relational databases follow the SQL schema-based model. MongoDB is schema-less, allowing for flexible and dynamic data models, while relational databases require predefined schemas.

4. What is a collection in MongoDB?
A collection in MongoDB is a grouping of individual documents, similar to a table in relational databases. Each document within a collection can have different fields and structures.

5. What is a document in MongoDB?
A document in MongoDB is a basic unit of data and corresponds to a single record in a collection. Documents are represented in BSON format and can have varying fields and values.

6. How do you create a new database in MongoDB?
In MongoDB, databases are created implicitly. You can simply start using a new database by storing data in it. If the database does not exist, MongoDB will create it automatically.

7. How do you insert a document in MongoDB?
To insert a document in MongoDB, you can use the `insertOne()` or `insertMany()` methods, depending on whether you want to insert a single document or multiple documents at once.

8. What is the `_id` field in MongoDB?
The `_id` field is a unique identifier for each document in a collection. MongoDB automatically assigns a unique `_id` to each document unless explicitly provided during insertion.

9. How can you find documents in MongoDB?
You can find documents in MongoDB using the `find()` method. You can pass a query object to filter the results based on specific criteria.

10. How do you update documents in MongoDB?
To update documents in MongoDB, you can use the `updateOne()` or `updateMany()` methods. You provide a filter to identify the documents to update and specify the changes using update operators.

11. Explain the difference between `updateOne()` and `updateMany()` in MongoDB.
`updateOne()` updates the first document that matches the filter, while `updateMany()` updates all documents that match the filter.

12. What is an index in MongoDB?
An index in MongoDB is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations. It helps in faster querying by creating a reference to the location of the data in the database.

13. How do you create an index in MongoDB?
You can create an index in MongoDB using the `createIndex()` method. You specify the field or fields to be indexed and the index type (ascending, descending, or hashed).

14. What are the types of indexes supported by MongoDB?
MongoDB supports several types of indexes, including single-field indexes, compound indexes, multi-key indexes, geospatial indexes, text indexes, and hashed indexes.

15. How do you delete a document in MongoDB?
To delete a document in MongoDB, you can use the `deleteOne()` or `deleteMany()` methods, depending on whether you want to delete a single document or multiple documents matching a filter.

16. What is the aggregation pipeline in MongoDB?
The aggregation pipeline in MongoDB allows you to process data from a collection through multiple stages, where each stage performs a specific operation on the data.

21. What is a replica set in MongoDB?
A replica set is a group of MongoDB servers that maintain the same data set, providing redundancy and high availability. It consists of a primary node and one or more secondary nodes.

22. How do you set up a replica set in MongoDB?
To set up a replica set in MongoDB, you need to start multiple MongoDB instances on different servers, configure them as a replica set in the configuration file, and initiate the replica set using the `rs.initiate()` method.

23. Explain the write concern in MongoDB.
Write concern in MongoDB determines the acknowledgment level requested from the server when performing write operations. It specifies the number of replicas that must acknowledge the write before the operation is considered successful.

24. What is the default write concern in MongoDB?
The default write concern in MongoDB is `{ w: 1 }`, meaning that the server acknowledges the write operation as successful after it has been written to the primary node.

25. How do you perform a backup in MongoDB?
You can perform a backup in MongoDB using tools like `mongodump` and `mongorestore`. `mongodump` creates a binary dump of the data, and `mongorestore` restores the data from the binary dump.

26. How does MongoDB provide high availability?
MongoDB achieves high availability through replica sets. If the primary node fails, one of the secondary nodes is automatically elected as the new primary, ensuring continuous availability of the database.

27. What is a covered query in MongoDB?
A covered query in MongoDB is a query where all the fields to be returned are covered by an index, eliminating the need to access the documents for further data retrieval.

28. How can you limit the fields returned in a MongoDB query?
You can use the `projection` parameter in the `find()` method or the `$project` stage in the aggregation pipeline to specify which fields to include or exclude from the query results.

You can list all the indexes on a collection by using the `getIndexes()` method on the collection object.

45. What are write concerns in MongoDB? Give an example.
Write concerns in MongoDB determine the acknowledgment level required for write operations. For example, `{ w: "majority", j: true }` means that the write must be acknowledged by a majority of the replica set members and journaled to be considered successful.
